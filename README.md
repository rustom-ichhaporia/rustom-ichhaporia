I study CS and statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm an internationally published James Scholar seeking opportunities in ML/AI to jumpstart my college career. 

I have diverse experience with Python, C#, R, SQL, research, entrepreneurship, and more. I've also presented research overseas on complex networks, neurobiology, finance, and particle physics data analysis, some of which you can find on this page.

On the side, I love to play and compose music. Feel free to message me on LinkedIn or send me an email.
